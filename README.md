Hidden File Toggle Widget
=========================

What it does
------------

Exactly what it sounds like, shows/hides hidden files.

Why
---

There was a widget that used to do this, but the mobile.me site was gone, so I decided to rebuild it.

Requirements
------------

OS X 10.4.1+, according to Dashcode.

Acknowledgments
---------------

The JS to do the actual toggle was inspired by a snippet from [Rixstep](http://rixstep.com/4/2/hf,00.shtml) via one Matthew Hansen.
